# Assignments

The purpose of the assignments is to further evaluate learnersâ€™ conceptual understanding of the material covered in class, and to demonstrate that they can perform the types of analysis covered in this course and that they can interpret the results. Assignments will be graded on a pass/fail basis, and feedback will be provided to students within one week of the submission dates.

**Class attendance**: To ensure everyone actively participates in class activities, attendance is mandatory and will be monitored. If you are unable to attend class, it is your responsibility to make up the work that was covered.
