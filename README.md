## Description
This section of the course will focus on the essentials of coding in Python. You will learn how to design functions, repeat code using loops, store data in lists, test and debug your code, and manipulate data using various data analysis and visualization tools such as `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `plotly`.
  
## Learning Outcomes
After completing this section of the course, the students will:
1. Understand various Python data types and their role in coding. This includes being able to differentiate and evaluate expressions using numeric types (integer, long, and floating-point numbers), Booleans, strings, and lists. This will be assessed in Assignment 1.
2. Be able to reduce the duplication of code by following the Function Design Recipe and creating functions in Python. This will be assessed in Assignment 1.
3. Be able to use `numpy` and `pandas` to analyze a dataset, more specifically, be able to use these libraries to manipulate numerical and tabular data in Python. This will be assessed in Assignments 1 and 2.
4. Know how to interact with databases via Python. This includes using visualization techniques like `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `plotly`. This will be assessed in Assignment 2.
5. Know how to debug and test Python code. Students will learn to troubleshoot errors and select test cases to check for the correctness, reliability, and robustness of code. This will be assessed in Assignments 1 and 2.

## Course Contacts
**Questions should first posted Slack Channel**

* Instructor: **Kaylie Lau** (she/her). Emails to the instructor can be sent to kaylie.lau@mail.utoronto.ca.
* Instructor: **Simeon Wong** (he/him). Emails to the instructor can be sent to simeonm.wong@mail.utoronto.ca
* TA: **Tong Su** (she/her). Emails to the teaching assistant can be sent to tong.su@mail.utoronto.ca.
* TA: **Julia Gallucci** (). Emails to the teaching assistant can be sent to julia.gallucci@mail.utoronto.ca

## Pre-Course Work
Before the first class please get your computer set up by following these instructions: https://github.com/dtxe/DSI-Onboarding/tree/windows_onboarding/environment_setup
 
## Design
The course runs synchronously over Zoom. The Python section consists of eight classes over two weeks. Classes are 6:00 PM - 8:30 PM EDT on weekdays, and 9:00 AM - 11:30 AM EDT on Saturday. Being mindful of online fatigue, there will be one or two breaks during each class where students are encouraged to stretch, grab a drink and snacks, or ask any additional questions. 

Tutorial sessions with a TA will also be offered over Zoom. These will take place from 5:30 PM - 6:00 PM EDT and 8:30 PM - 9:00 PM on weekdays, and 8:30 AM - 9:00 AM EDT and 11:30 AM - 12:00 PM EDT on Saturdays. 
 
## Schedule
Schedule is tentative and may be modified as needed. Learners will be notified of schedule changes.
* **Day 1 (Monday, January 22, 6:00 PM - 8:30 PM):** Getting Started I (Introduction; Python fundamentals)
* **Day 2 (Tuesday, January 23, 6:00 PM - 8:30 PM):** Getting Started II (Python fundamentals)
* **Day 3 (Wednesday, January 24, 6:00 PM - 8:30 PM):** Dealing with Reality (Control flow using conditionals and loops; Lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries)
* **Day 4 (Thursday, January 25, 6:00 PM - 8:30 PM):** In/Out (Modules; Working with files; Object-oriented programming)
* **Day 5 (Tuesday, January 30, 6:00 PM - 8:30 PM):** Doing More with Data I (`numpy`)
* **Day 6 (Wednesday, January 31, 6:00 PM - 8:30 PM):** Doing More with Data II (`pandas`)
* **Day 7 (Thursday, February 1, 6:00 PM - 8:30 PM):** Visualizing Data (`matplotlib`; `seaborn`; `plotly`)
* **Day 8 (Saturday, February 3, 9:00 AM - 11:30 AM):** Case Study Speaker

## Prerequisites
Learners are expected to know how to operate a computer and are also expected to be familiar with the parts of a data table or spreadsheet, summary statistics, and basic data visualizations. No prior programming knowledge is required.

## Expectations
The course is a live coding class. Learners are expected to follow along with the coding in their own Python notebooks. Learners should be active participants while coding and are encouraged to ask questions throughout. Although slides will be available, they should be referenced before or after class, as the class will be dedicated to coding with the instructor.
 
### Technology requirements
* Learners must have a computer and an internet connection to participate in online activities
* Learners must have set up their computer using this [link](https://github.com/dtxe/DSI-Onboarding/tree/windows_onboarding/environment_setup)
 
## Policies
* **Accessibility:** We want to provide an accessible learning environment for all. If there is something we can do to make this course more accessible to you, please let us know.
* **Course communications:** Communications take place over email or on Slack. Please include "DSI-Python" or similar in the subject line, e.g. "DSI-Python: pandas question"
* **Camera:** Keeping your camera on is optional.
* **Microphone:** Please keep microphones muted unless you need to speak. Please indicate your name before speaking as some Zoom configurations make it hard to tell who is talking!
* **Assessment:** There will be homework which is **not** graded, but highly recommended, and there will be three assignments which **are** graded.
