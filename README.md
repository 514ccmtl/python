## Description
This module will introduce learners to the foundamentals of programming in Python. In the first week, they will learn how to write a block of code using variables, conditionals and loops. In the second week, the learners will more learn advanced topics such as Object Oriented Programming, and testing. As well, they will be introduced to `numPy`, used for scientific computing.

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of the module, learners will:

**Week 1:**
1. Write block of code in Python using variables and conditionals
2. Identify the differences between different data types
3. Use a loop to go over elements of an array
4. Identify and resolve errors

**Week 2:**
1. Describe the benefits of Object Oriented programming
2. Write a block of code as a reuseable function
3. Use manual and automated testing to ensure block of code works as expected
4. Use the numPy to perform mathematical operations on arrays and datasets

## Assignments
There are two weekly assignments in this module:

|Name|Description|
|---|---|
|Anagram Checker|Anagram Checker is a program that takes two words and see if an anagram can be made from it. If so, the program will return `true`, otherwise `false`.|
|Efficacy Analysis of a Hypothetical Arthritis Drug | Imagine a clinical trial where 60 patients were administered a new drug for arthritis. Data from this trial has been recorded in a series of CSV files. Evaluate the effectiveness of a fictional medication designed to reduce inflammation caused by arthritis flare-ups.|

## Course Contacts
**Questions can be submitted to the #questions channel on Slack**

* Instructor: **{Name}** {Pronouns}. Emails to the instructor can be sent to {first_name.last_name}@mail.utoronto.ca.
* TA: **{Name}** {Pronouns}. Emails to the instructor can be sent to {first_name.last_name}@mail.utoronto.ca.
 
## Delivery of Module

The module will run sychronously twice a week on Zoom. The first two days are used as "instructional days" and will last a maximum of 3 hours. During this time, the instructor will introduce the concepts for the week. The last two days are used for as optional, asychronous work periods. The work periods will also last for up to 3 hours. During these two days, an instructor or TA will be present on Zoom to assist learners reach the intended learning outcomes.

### How the Instructor will deliver
The instructors will introduce the concepts through a collaborative live coding session usiing the Python notebooks found under `/slides`. All instructors will also upload any live coding files to this repository for any learners to revisit under `/live-code`.
 
### Expectations
Learners are encouraged to be active participants while coding and are encouraged to ask questions throughout the module.

## Schedule
The schedule is tentative and may be modified as needed. Learners will be notified of schedule changes.

||Day 1|Day 2|Day 3|Day 4|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Week 1|Instructional Day (Data Types and Control Flow, Errors)|Work Period 1|Instructional Day (Inputs and Strings, Type Conversion)|Work Period 2|
|Week 2|Instructional Day (Functions, Testing)|Work Period 1|Instructional Day (Object Oriented Programming, numPy)|Work Period 2|
 
## Policies
* **Accessibility:** We want to provide an accessible learning environment for all. If there is something we can do to make this course more accessible to you, please let us know.
* **Course communications:** Communications take place over email or on Slack. If communicating over email, please include "DSI-Python" or similar in the subject line, e.g. "DSI-Python: pandas question"
* **Camera:** Keeping your camera on is optional.
* **Microphone:** Please keep microphones muted unless you need to speak. Please indicate your name before speaking as some Zoom configurations make it hard to tell who is talking!
* **Assessment:** There will be homework which **is not** graded, but highly recommended, and there will be two assignments which **are** graded.
 
## Technology requirements
* Learners must have a computer and an internet connection to participate in online activities.
* Learners must have set up their computer using this [link](https://github.com/UofT-DSI/Onboarding/tree/tech-onboarding-docs).
