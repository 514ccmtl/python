## Description
This module introduces learners to the fundamentals of programming using Python. Coding is an essential skill that equips them to solve complex mathematical problems, analyze data, and visualize it. Learners will be introduced to programming concepts such as functions and object-oriented programming to make use of reusable blocks of code and models respectively. As well as numPy, a library tool for both data science and machine learning work. By the end of this module, learners will feel equipped to write reusable code, and analyze data. The contents in this module lays the foundation for all future modules to create complex data science and machine learning models.

No coding experience is needed to take this module!

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of the module, learners will:

**Week 1:**
1. Write block of code in Python using variables and conditionals
2. Identify the differences between different data types
3. Use a loop to go over elements of an array
4. Identify and resolve errors

**Week 2:**
1. Describe the benefits of Object Oriented programming
2. Write a block of code as a reuseable function
3. Use manual and automated testing to ensure block of code works as expected
4. Use the numPy to perform mathematical operations on arrays and datasets

## Assignments
There are two weekly assignments in this module:

|Name|Description|
|---|---|
|Anagram Checker|Anagram Checker is a program that takes two words and see if an anagram can be made from it. If so, the program will return `true`, otherwise `false`.|
|Efficacy Analysis of a Hypothetical Arthritis Drug | Imagine a clinical trial where 60 patients were administered a new drug for arthritis. Data from this trial has been recorded in a series of CSV files. Evaluate the effectiveness of a fictional medication designed to reduce inflammation caused by arthritis flare-ups.|

## Module Contacts
**Questions can be submitted to the #questions channel on Slack**

* Technical Facilitator: **{Name}** {Pronouns}. Emails to the Technical Facilitator can be sent to {first_name.last_name}@mail.utoronto.ca.
* Learning Support Staff: **{Name}** {Pronouns}. Emails to the Technical Facilitator can be sent to {first_name.last_name}@mail.utoronto.ca.
 
## Delivery of Module
The module will run sychronously up twice a week on Zoom. The first two days are used as "lectures" and will last a maximum of 3 hours. During this time, the Technical Facilitator will introduce the concepts for the week. The last two days are used for as optional, asychronous work periods. The work periods will also last for up to 3 hours. During these two days, an Technical Facilitator or TA will be present on Zoom to assist learners reach the intended learning outcomes.

### How the Technical Facilitator will deliver
The Technical Facilitators will introduce the concepts through a collaborative live coding session usiing the Python notebooks found under `/01_slides`. All Technical Facilitators will also upload any live coding files to this repository for any learners to revisit under `/live_code`.
 
### Expectations
Learners are encouraged to be active participants while coding and are encouraged to ask questions throughout the module.

## Schedule
The schedule is tentative and may be modified as needed. Learners will be notified of schedule changes.

||Day 1|Day 2|Day 3|Day 4|Day 5|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Week 1|Lecture 1 (Data Types and Control Flow, Errors)|Lecture 2 (Inputs and Strings, Type Conversion)|Case Study|Work Period 1|Work Period 2|
|Week 2|Lecture 3 (Functions, Testing)|Lecture 4 (Object Oriented Programming, numPy)|Case Study|Work Period 1|Work Period 2|
 
## Policies
* **Accessibility:** We want to provide an accessible learning environment for all. If there is something we can do to make this Module more accessible to you, please let us know.
* **Module communications:** Communications take place over email or on Slack. If communicating over email, please include "DSI-Python" or similar in the subject line, e.g. "DSI-Python: pandas question"
* **Camera:** Keeping your camera on is optional.
* **Microphone:** Please keep microphones muted unless you need to speak. Please indicate your name before speaking as some Zoom configurations make it hard to tell who is talking!
* **Assessment:** There will be homework which **is not** graded, but highly recommended, and there will be two assignments which **are** graded.
 
## Requirements
* Learners are not expected to have any coding experience, we designed the learning contents for beginners.
* Learners are encouraged to ask questions, and collaborate with others to enhance learning.
* Learners must have a computer and an internet connection to participate in online activities.
* Learners must have VSCode installed with the following extensions: 
    * [Jupyter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter)
    * [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)
* Learners must not use generative AI such as ChatGPT to generate code in order to complete assignments. It should be use as a supportive tool to seek out answers to questions you may have.
* We expect learners to have completed the [onboarding repo](https://github.com/UofT-DSI/Onboarding/tree/tech-onboarding-docs).
* Camera is optional although highly encouraged. We understand that not everyone may have the space at home to have the camera on.
