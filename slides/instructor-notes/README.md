# Instructor Notes

## Week 1

### Instructional Day 1
The focus of the first lecture is to deliver the `data_types` and `control_flow` content first, and let the cohort play around with it via `homework` or `assignment`. For `control_flow`, focus on `conditionals` and `for loops`. Allow the rest of the cohort to go through the rest of the Python notebook and learn from it interactively.

### Instructional Day 2
The focus of the second lecture is to deliver the `comments_and_errors`, `inputs`, `strings`, and `converting_types` content next. For `converting_types`, you can allow the cohort to go through the `converting_types` asychronously, rather than sychronously.

## Week 2

### Instructional Day 1
Introduce the cohort to `functions` and `testing`. Spend more time on `functions` and emphasize how it allows anyone to create reusable block of code.

### Instructional Day 2
Introduce the cohort next to `object_oriented_programming` and `numPy`. The emphasis will be on `numPy` as it is needed for their second assignment.
